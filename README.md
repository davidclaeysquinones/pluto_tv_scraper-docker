### Paths

#### Config

The settings file is located under `/config/config.json`.
Under the `mapping` section you can specify which IP adresses are used to obtain the channels in a certain country.
By default some IP adresses are provided in the default configuration file, however these might not work over time.
You can use [ip2location by country](https://lite.ip2location.com/ip-address-ranges-by-country) and [ip2location lookup](https://www.iplocation.net/ip-lookup) to obtain an IP in a certain country.

For each country a `.m3u8` and `.xml` file will be generated.
The expected formats are `plutotv_{country}.m3u8` and `plutotv_{country}.xml`.
If you include more than one country in the mapping section `plutotv_all.m3u8` and `plutotv_all.xml` also will be generated.
